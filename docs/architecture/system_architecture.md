# OpenEvolve System Architecture

## Overview

The OpenEvolve autonomous development pipeline is a comprehensive system designed to automate code generation, evaluation, and evolution using Large Language Models (LLMs) and evolutionary algorithms. This document describes the system architecture, component interactions, and design principles.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Modular Design

- **Pluggable Architecture**: Components can be easily replaced or extended

### 2. Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Components can be distributed across multiple instances
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better performance
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization and cleanup

### 3. Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and alerting
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even with component failures

### 4. Observability
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging throughout the system
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and operational metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing
